# Neorg Haskell Parser

Neorg Haskell Parser aims to be a complete implementation of the [Neorg markup specification](https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg/blob/main/docs/NFF-0.1-spec.md). Furthermore, it should be able to transform .norg files to the [pandoc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc) AST and subsequently to the plethora of formats that pandoc supports.

## Installation

### Using a precompiled binary

I have added a compiled binary for linux in the `release` folder, which should work on most x86 linux systems.

### Building from Source

You will need ghc and cabal. Then you can build the project with:
```bash
cabal build neorg-pandoc
``` 

You can run the tests with:
```bash
cabal run test
```

## Usage

After having aquired a binary of `neorg-pandoc`, you can use it to transform Neorg files into Pandoc json documents. `neorg-pandoc` expects exactly one parameter, which should be the file path to the Neorg file. If parsing was successful, the json document is printed to stdout.

An example usage might be:
```bash
./neorg-pandoc-linux86 testing/test.norg | pandoc -f json -o testing/out.pdf
```

Here, I have used the `neorg-pandoc-linux86` binary to transform my `norg` file into the pandoc `json` format. The result is piped into pandoc to create a pdf. The `-f json` argument tells pandoc that the input is a `json` file  and `-o testing/out.pdf` is the location of the `pdf` file. It is also possible to transform your `norg` file into other formats; for example to markdown by replacing `-o testing/out.pdf` with `-o testing/out.md`. For further options refer to the `pandoc` documentation.
